# SwiftFormer-Pytorch

## SwiftFormer: Efficient Additive Attention for Transformer-based Real-time Mobile Vision Applications (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.15446.pdf)

This is a warehouse for SwiftFormer model, can be used to train your image datasets, The ___confusion_matrix.png___ and ___multi_classes_roc.png___ images inside are generated by evaluating the model after training five epochs and are for reference only.

## Project Structure
```
  ├── datasets: Load datasets
  	  ├── my_dataset.py: Customize reading data sets and define transforms data enhancement methods
  	  ├── split_data.py: Define the function to read the image dataset and divide the training-set and test-set
  	  ├── threeaugment.py: Additional data augmentation methods
  ├── models: SwiftFormer Model
  	  ├── swiftformer.py: Construct "SwiftFormer" model
  ├── util: 
  	  ├── engine.py: Function code for a training/validation process
      ├── losses.py: Knowledge distillation loss, combined with teacher model (if any)
  	  ├── optimizer.py: Define Sophia optimizer
  	  ├── samplers.py: Define the parameter of "sampler" in DataLoader
      ├── utils.py: Record various indicator information and output and distributed environment
  ├── estimate_model.py: Visualized evaluation indicators ROC curve, confusion matrix, classification report, etc.
  └── train_gpu.py: Training model startup file
```

## Precautions
Before you use the code to train your own data set, please first enter the ___train_gpu.py___ file and modify the ___data_root___, ___batch_size___ and ___nb_classes___ parameters. If you want to draw the confusion matrix and ROC curve, you only need to remove the comments of ___Plot_ROC___ and ___Predictor___ at the end of the code. For the third parameter, you should change it to the path of your own model weights file(.pth).

## Use Sophia Optimizer (in util/optimizer.py)
You can use anther optimizer sophia, just need to change the optimizer in ___train_gpu.py___, for this training sample, can achieve better results
```
# optimizer = create_optimizer(args, model_without_ddp)
optimizer = SophiaG(model.parameters(), lr=2e-4, betas=(0.965, 0.99), rho=0.01, weight_decay=args.weight_decay)
```

## Train this model

### Parameters Meaning:
```
1. nproc_per_node: <The number of GPUs you want to use on each node (machine/server)>
2. CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES: <Specify the index of the GPU corresponding to a single node (machine/server) (starting from 0)>
3. nnodes: <number of nodes (machine/server)>
4. node_rank: <node (machine/server) serial number>
5. master_addr: <master node (machine/server) IP address>
6. master_port: <master node (machine/server) port number>
```
### Note: 
If you want to use multiple GPU for training, whether it is a single machine with multiple GPUs or multiple machines with multiple GPUs, each GPU will divide the batch_size equally. For example, batch_size=4 in my train_gpu.py. If I want to use 2 GPUs for training, each GPU will divide the batch_size. That means batch_size=2 on each GPU. ___Do not let batch_size=1 on each GPU___, otherwise BN layer maybe report an error.

### train model with single-machine single-GPU：
```
python train_gpu.py
```

### train model with single-machine multi-GPU：
```
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=8 train_gpu.py
```

### train model with single-machine multi-GPU: 
(using a specified part of the GPUs: for example, I want to use the second and fourth GPUs)
```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=1,3 python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=2 train_gpu.py
```

### train model with multi-machine multi-GPU:
(For the specific number of GPUs on each machine, modify the value of --nproc_per_node. If you want to specify a certain GPU, just add CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES= to specify the index number of the GPU before each command. The principle is the same as single-machine multi-GPU training)
```
On the first machine: python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=1 --nnodes=2 --node_rank=0 --master_addr=<Master node IP address> --master_port=<Master node port number> train_gpu.py

On the second machine: python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=1 --nnodes=2 --node_rank=1 --master_addr=<Master node IP address> --master_port=<Master node port number> train_gpu.py
